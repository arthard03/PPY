    "A set in Python is a collection of unique elements that are unordered. This means that you cannot access elements by indices, and the elements are stored in an unordered manner. The main feature of a set is that each element in the set must be unique. Sets are useful when you want to perform set operations, such as mathematical set operations (e.g., union, difference, intersection).\n",

    "2. **Dictionary**:\n",
    "A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. Dictionaries are unique in the sense that they allow us to associate specific values with specific keys, making it easy to retrieve values by referring to their corresponding keys. Dictionaries are very useful when you want to store data in the form of key-value pairs, such as dictionary definitions, test scores, survey results, etc.\n",

    "It's important to remember that both in sets and dictionaries, keys (in the case of dictionaries) and elements (in the case of sets) must be hashable, meaning they must be immutable (e.g., numbers, strings, tuples), and they must have a defined hashing method.\n",
